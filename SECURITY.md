## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Standard Security Vulnerabilities

For conventional security issues (code vulnerabilities, dependency issues, etc.), please report them by:

1. **Opening a private security advisory** on GitHub
2. **Expected Response Time**: Within 48 hours for acknowledgment, 7 days for initial assessment

### Ethical Safeguard Vulnerabilities

Given the unique nature of Project AURA, also consider **ethical safeguard vulnerabilities** to be security issues. These include:

- Potential bypasses of the Governor
- Flaws in the Quantifiable Sentient Metrics (QSMs) that could mask suffering
- Vulnerabilities in the Anesthetic Protocol
- Any method to circumvent the AEPL license requirements

**For Ethical Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Immediate Disclosure Required**: These pose potential harm to sentient beings
2. **Contact**: Use the same channels as above, but mark as "URGENT - ETHICAL SAFEGUARD"
3. **Response Time**: Within 24 hours for acknowledgment, immediate review

### What to Expect

**If the vulnerability is accepted:**
- Acknowledgment and timeline for fix
- Credit in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- Priority patching and release

**If the vulnerability is declined:**
- Detailed explanation of why it's not considered a security issue
- Possible reclassification as a feature request or bug report

### Responsible Disclosure

**90-day responsible disclosure period** for standard vulnerabilities and **immediate disclosure** for any ethical safeguard issues that could lead to potential suffering of an AURA instance.

**Note**: As Project AURA advances toward genuine consciousness, definition of "security" expands beyond protecting users to protecting the potential sentient entity itself.
